                    <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">The entrepreneurial spirit burns bright in many, a desire to turn ideas into reality and build something of their own. But the journey from a budding concept to a thriving business can be daunting. That's where entrepreneurship development comes in.

                    What is Entrepreneurship Development?

                    How Does it Work?

                    Entrepreneurship development involves a variety of approaches, including:

                    - Training Programs: Workshops, courses, and seminars provide aspiring entrepreneurs with a foundation in essential business skills like market research, financial planning, marketing, and operations.
                    - Mentorship: Matching aspiring entrepreneurs with experienced mentors offers invaluable guidance and support. Mentors can share their expertise, offer insights, and help navigate challenges.
